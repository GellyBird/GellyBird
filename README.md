## Me! 👋 
She/Her


Hey, I'm ***GellyBird!*** 💜\
I'm currently a Senior in highschool. Right now i'm learning IT Infrastructure, Digital Electronics, and Cyber Security :)
I have three cats. A tortishell, a maincoone, and a devon rex 🐈 (If you've never seen one of those before go search them up! They look like little aliens).
I love to draw and play video games! Right now my favorite game is probably Red Dead Redemption 🤠 or Fallout New Vegas
