## Me! 👋
Hey, I'm `GellyBird!`\
I'm currently a sophmore in highschool. Right now im learning python in my AP CSP class and honestly, I'm really enjoying it so far.\
I have three cats; a tortishell, a maincoone, and a devon rex 🐈 (If you've never seen one of those before go search them up! They look like little aliens).
 I love to draw and play video games! Right now my favorite game is probably Red Dead Redemption, even though the story made me cry a bit. 🤠
